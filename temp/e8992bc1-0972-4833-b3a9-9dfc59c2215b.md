# Sales Forecasting System

A machine learning-based system for forecasting sales units and revenue using historical sales data.

## Features

- Loads and processes historical sales data from Excel files
- Extracts and engineers time-based features (Month, Year, Quarter, Day of Week)
- Handles categorical variables through encoding
- Trains separate Random Forest models for sales and revenue predictions
- Provides model evaluation metrics including R² scores and cross-validation
- Generates visualizations for:
  - Feature importance analysis
  - Predicted vs actual values comparison

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy 
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage

1. Prepare your sales data in Excel format with the following columns:
   - Date
   - Product
   - Region
   - Seasonality
   - Marketing_Spend
   - Customer_Rating
   - Economic_Indicator
   - Sales_Units
   - Revenue

2. Initialize and run the forecasting system:
    ```python
    from sales_forecasting import SalesForecasting
    system = SalesForecasting('path_to_your_data.xlsx')
    system.run()
    ```

3. The system will load the data, preprocess it, train the models, and generate visualizations.

4. The visualizations will be saved in the `plots` directory.

## Model Details

The sales forecasting system uses Random Forest Regression models with the following specifications:

- Number of trees (n_estimators): 100 
- Features used:
  - Month
  - Quarter 
  - Day of Week
  - Product (encoded)
  - Region (encoded)
  - Marketing Spend
  - Seasonality (encoded)
  - Customer Rating
  - Economic Indicator

The system performs:
- 80/20 train-test split
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- 5-fold cross-validation
- Separate models for sales units and revenue predictions

## Output

The system provides:
1. Model Performance Metrics
   - R² scores for both sales and revenue models
   - Cross-validation scores
   
2. Visualizations
   - Feature importance plots showing the relative importance of each predictor
   - Scatter plots comparing predicted vs actual values
   - Trend analysis of predictions
